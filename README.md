With the rapid development of information technology, the era of big data has arrived, and data is increasingly becoming an important production factor in human society. Data visualization, that is, the presentation of data in an intuitive and easy-to-understand form for humans, is an important part of data mining as well as information presentation, and is of great significance for discovering the value behind the data.

VSlide, a web-based data visualization tool, was created to make it easy for the average user to create presentations that support interactive data visualization charts.
